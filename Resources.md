TODO:
- expand the complexity of objects in the project
- add more complex validation checks
- retest the flow with more complex scenarios
- test the flow with schema first APIs
- think of how to tie in the documentation writer agent, or maybe it's better to keep it separately
- see how to imporve perfrmance of the inspector agent - review the VSCode agent docs and guidelines.
